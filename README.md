## Quick start

1.  Make sure that you have Node.js v8.15.1 and npm v5 or above installed.
2.  Clone this repo
3.  Move to the appropriate directory: `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.<br />
4.  Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies.<br />
    _At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3000`._
    
## Usage

1) The home page is empty.
2) Click on play to see the game.
3) There are 3 difficulty levels -- Easy, Medium and Difficult.
4) Easy has 10 mines on the grid, medium has 20 and Difficult has 30 mines.
5) The number of rows and columns are not configurable as of now. But this could be an enhancement to the project.

## Enhancements

1) Usage of proper icons instead of just strings.
2) Grids don't work well on different devices, so we could think of converting these into sections or cards.
3) Improve the UI to give it a game look. It looks pretty bland now.
4) Add unit tests to atleast test the reducers.
